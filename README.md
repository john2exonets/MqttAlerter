# MqttAlerter
Send out Alerts via SMS and/or Facebook Messenger based on MQTT "Alert/" packets received

This program uses the IFTTT WebHook service to connect incoming "Alert" messages from MQTT to send out the alert message via SMS and/or Facebook Messenger.  Other messaging services can be easily added.

The config.json file has a list of alerts to ignore...in case you have old or malfunctioning sensors that I have ;)
